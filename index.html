       <p>
         From art, algriculture, religion, archutecture, and much more, Ancient Rome has one of the largest impacts on modern life and culture.
        <br>
        Their population was predicted to be around 50-90 million, with their religion being polytheiestic (each city would pray to diffrent gods.)
        <br>
        Acourding to legend, Romoulus and his twin brother Remus founded Rome after killing the king of Alba Longa. Romulus then killed Remus and became the frist king of Rome.
        <br>
        Their dominate language was Latin.
